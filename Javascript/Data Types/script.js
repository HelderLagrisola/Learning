//JavaScript data types can be broadly categorized into primitive and non-primitive types. 
// Primitive types include String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, and BigInt.
//  Non-primitive types include Object, Array, and Function.
//  Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming in JavaScript.

//Primitive Data Types
let String = "Hello World" // This is string data type
let number = 2; //This is number 
let Boolean = true; //This is boolean data type : it's either true or false 
let Undefined = undefined; // This is undefined data type
let Null =  null; // This is null data type
console.log(String,number,Boolean,Undefined,Null); // To print all of the data type to the console
