//In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data within a program. 
// They act as containers that hold different types of information, such as numbers, text, or objects, and allow you to manipulate and work with that data in your code.




var variables = "this is variable var"
let variableLet = "this is variable let"
const variableConst = "this is const variable"




//Print to console section
console.log(variableLet)
console.log(variables)
console.log(variableConst)
